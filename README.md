# React Redux App

## Getting Started

To get started with this app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-app.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the app: `npm start`

## Create Store

To create a store, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file `store.js` and import `configureStore` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
2. Create a store instance using `configureStore` and pass an empty object as the reducer.
3. Export the store instance.

## Create Feature Slice

To create a feature slice, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory `features` and a subdirectory for your feature (e.g. `todos`).
2. Create a new file `todoSlice.js` inside the feature directory and import `createSlice` from `@reduxjs/toolkit`.
3. Define the initial state and reducers for the feature using `createSlice`.
4. Export the actions and reducer from the slice.

## Using Redux in Components

To use Redux in components, follow these steps:

1. Import `useSelector` and `useDispatch` from `react-redux`.
2. Use `useSelector` to select a slice of state from the store.
3. Use `useDispatch` to dispatch actions to the store.
4. Use the actions and state in your component to render the UI.

## Connect to the Store

To connect your component to the store, wrap your app with the `Provider` component from `react-redux` and pass the store instance as a prop.
